It includes:

- **Jupyter Notebook analysis** with data cleaning, trend analysis, statistical testing, and time-series forecasting.
- An interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** allowing users to explore:
  - Trends of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2)
  - Seasonal variations
  - City-wise comparisons
  - Health risk categorization based on PM2.5 levels
- Visualisations and insights to understand the impact of events like COVID-19 lockdowns on pollution levels.
